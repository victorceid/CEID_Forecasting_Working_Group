```

## R Markdown

This RMarkdown will be an example of a pipeline based on ARIMA models and on Weighted Intervak Score.

```{r cars}
# Dataset input

# Model fitting

# Model forecasting

# Model validation
  
  # WIS

  # Calculate the quantiles
  # Calculate the WIS

  # Other methods



```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
